## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Crescent Falchion** +1 from 4-1 is OP early.
- Dragon path is great early on â€” no scaling, just power.
- Blueblood Sword needs 50 Luck + Fatal Dagger backup for farming.
- Use **White World Tendency** for better drop rates on upgrade mats.
- Farm **Lizard locations** before world tendency changes.

## âš  Brutal Truth:
Upgrade paths arenâ€™t suggestions â€” theyâ€™re commitments. Screw it up and youâ€™ll waste mats or souls. Plan your endgame weapon before you hit +3.
