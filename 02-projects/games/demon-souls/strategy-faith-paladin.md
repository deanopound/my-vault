## 1. Starting Class
- **Knight or Soldier**:  
  - Knight has solid starting Vitality and Endurance.  
  - Soldier has decent Strength for early weapon use.  
- You’ll respec stats with Saint Urbain’s soul later to pump Faith fast.

---

## 2. Early Goals
- Get your **Meat Cleaver** or **Blessed Weapons** ASAP (1-1 Phalanx drop for Meat Cleaver).  
- Focus on **Faith** and **Vitality** first.  
- Raise **Endurance** for stamina and equip load (to wear decent armor).  
- Keep Strength & Dexterity enough to wield Blessed weapons.

---

## 3. Early Farming Route
- Farm **1-1 Phalanx enemies** using ranged Soul Arrows or safely with melee once upgraded.  
- Stockpile **Pure White and Black Tendency** to access key NPC and questlines.  
- Head to **Nexus** after a few runs to upgrade your blessed weapon.

---

## 4. Miracles to Prioritize Early
- **Regeneration**: Huge survivability boost.  
- **Second Chance**: Get this fast—game changer for boss fights and farming.  
- **Firestorm** (if you want extra DPS).

---

## 5. Weapon and Gear Progression
- Upgrade **Blessed Meat Cleaver** for HP regen with each hit.  
- Equip **Saint’s Set** or mid-weight armor for a good balance of poise and mobility.  
- Use **Ring of Devout Prayer** and **Regenerator’s Ring** early for Faith and HP regen bonuses.

---

## 6. Leveling Priorities  
- **Faith (FTH)** to 36+ ASAP.  
- **Vitality (VIT)** to 25+.  
- **Endurance (END)** to 25+ for stamina and armor equip.  
- **Strength (STR)** and **Dexterity (DEX)** just enough for weapon requirements.

---

## Brutal Truth:  
Faith Paladin is slow to power spike early if you don’t farm Pure White Tendency and Blessed weapons fast. Skip bosses you can’t kill quickly and farm souls/miracles relentlessly. Healing + buffs carry you through the toughest parts.

---

## Summary  
- Respec early for Faith focus.  
- Prioritize Blessed weapons and key miracles.  
- Tank with regen and buffs, don’t get greedy.  
- Upgrade weapons over armor first.
