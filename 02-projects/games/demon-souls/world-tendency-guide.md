## ðŸ§­ What Is World Tendency?
A hidden mechanic that affects:
- Enemy difficulty
- Item drops
- NPC appearance
- Events
- Access to rare items/weapons

## âšª Pure White Tendency (PWT)

- **1-1**: Executioner Miralda appears.
- **2-2**: Scirvir the Wanderer appears.
- **3-2**: Lord Rydell can be freed.

## âš« Pure Black Tendency (PBT)

## ðŸ“Š How to Manage Tendency

### General Rules:
- Tendency shifts per world, not globally.
- Nexus has its own tendency (used for Mephistopheles quest).
- Do everything in **soul form** unless boosting White Tendency.
- Go **offline** to prevent server resets.

## ðŸ—‚ Tracking Events
Keep a checklist for:
- PWT door unlocks
- PBT Black Phantom kills
- Primeval Demon locations (1 per world)

---

## ðŸ’€ Brutal Truth:
If you mess up tendency, you're stuck until NG+. Donâ€™t die in body form. Go offline. Track every death. This system punishes ignorance.
