## 1. Combat Basics
- **Stamina = Life**: Never let it hit zero. Always keep enough to roll or block.  
- **Patience beats aggression**: Learn enemy patterns. Don’t button mash.  
- **Roll Timing**: Invincibility frames are your best friend. Roll through attacks, not away.  
- **Backstab and parry**: Learn enemy tells. Parrying boss attacks wastes time but can make fights safer.

## 2. Weapon & Upgrade Tips
- Upgrade your main weapon first. Damage > defense.  
- Use **sharp/quality** weapons against humans.  
- Use **magic/fire** weapons vs. armored or elemental-resistant enemies.  
- Keep a backup weapon for enemies resistant to your main weapon’s damage type.

## 3. Farming & Souls Management
- Farm early enemies repeatedly before bosses.  
- Don’t spend souls on useless gear or stats you won’t use.  
- Use the **Ring of Great Strength** to carry heavier gear without fat rolling.  
- Beware of dying to stupidity — losing 50k+ souls hurts.

## 4. Nexus & World Tendency
- Use Nexus to level, reallocate stats, and upgrade gear.  
- Monitor **World Tendency** carefully. Pure white unlocks unique NPCs, black spawns harder enemies but better loot.  
- Push Pure White Tendency for key events, but keep a balance to farm black tendency items too.

## 5. General Survival
- Always carry at least one **health regeneration item** or miracle.  
- Don’t rush bosses — clear surrounding mobs first.  
- Learn when to parry, block, or roll.  
- Be ruthless with dodging, especially against boss combos.

---

## 6. Online Play
- Summon help for tough bosses if stuck (co-op).  
- Beware invading players in black tendency worlds — don’t farm recklessly.  
- Use online to learn boss patterns and tricks.

## Brutal Truth:
If you die repeatedly, you’re either impatient or sloppy. Fix it. Learn, adapt, execute. Stop hoping for lucky breaks.
